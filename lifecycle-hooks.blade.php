## Class Hooks

Each Livewire component undergoes a lifecycle. Lifecycle hooks allow you to run code at any part of the component's lifecyle, or before specific properties are updated.

@component('components.table')
Hooks | Description
--- | ---
mount | Runs once, immediately after the component is instantiated, but before `render()` is called
hydrate | Runs on every request, after the component is hydrated, but before an action is performed, or `render()` is called
hydrateFoo | Runs after a property called `$foo` is hydrated
dehydrate | Runs on every request, before the component is dehydrated, but after `render()` is called
dehydrateFoo | Runs before a property called `$foo` is dehydrated
updating | Runs before any update to the Livewire component's data (Using `wire:model`, not directly inside PHP)
updated | Runs after any update to the Livewire component's data (Using `wire:model`, not directly inside PHP)
updatingFoo | Runs before a property called `$foo` is updated
updatedFoo | Runs after a property called `$foo` is updated
updatingFooBar | Runs before updating a nested property `bar` on the `$foo` property
updatedFooBar | Runs after updating a nested property `bar` on the `$foo` property
@endcomponent

@component('components.code', ['lang' => 'php'])
class HelloWorld extends Component
{
    public $foo;

    public function mount()
    {
        //
    }

    public function hydrateFoo($value)
    {
        //
    }

    public function dehydrateFoo($value)
    {
        //
    }

    public function hydrate()
    {
        //
    }

    public function dehydrate()
    {
        //
    }

    public function updating($name, $value)
    {
        //
    }

    public function updated($name, $value)
    {
        //
    }

    public function updatingFoo($value)
    {
        //
    }

    public function updatedFoo($value)
    {
        //
    }

    public function updatingFooBar($value)
    {
        //
    }

    public function updatedFooBar($value)

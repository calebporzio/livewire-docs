# Nesting Components

Livewire supports nesting components. This feature allows you to compose components from other components, which is an incredibly powerful architectural pattern.

Here is an example of a nested component:

@codeComponent([
    'viewName' => 'show-users.blade.php',
])
@slot('view')
@verbatim
<div>
    @livewire('user-profile', $user)
</div>
@endverbatim
@endslot
@endcodeComponent

@warning
A common misconception is that properties passed into Livewire components is "reactive" (like Vue or React). Because of the way Livewire architects components, this is impossible. The data you pass into a nested component is set initially and not updated if the parent changes. For all component interactions, refer to the <a href="/docs/events">Events page.</a>

## Keyed Components

Similar to VueJs, if you render a component inside a loop, Livewire has trouble keeping track of changes made to those components. To remedy this, livewire offers a special "key" syntax:

@codeComponent([
    'viewName' => 'show-users.blade.php',
])
@slot('view')
@verbatim
<div>
    @foreach ($users as $user)
        @livewire('user-profile', $user, key($user->id))
    @endforeach
</div>
@endverbatim
@endslot
@endcodeComponent

> Note: Livewire doesn't actually call PHP's "key()" function, it just uses "key()" as a signifier in it's blade parser.
